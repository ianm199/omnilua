# Contributing to lua-rs

Thanks for your interest in `lua-rs` — a pure-Rust Lua interpreter that runs Lua
5.1 through 5.5 from one core (5.4 is the stable baseline). This guide covers how
to build it, how to run the tests, the project layout, and the code-style rules
the project enforces. For the agent-facing operational guide (the iteration
ladder, the multi-version oracle, benchmarks), see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Prerequisites

- A recent stable Rust toolchain (`rustup` recommended; the workspace pins
  `rust-version = "1.77"`).
- A POSIX shell for the harness scripts.

## Build

```bash
cargo build --bin lua-rs            # debug build of the CLI
cargo build --release --bin lua-rs  # optimized build
cargo build --workspace --bins      # everything
```

The debug binary lands at `target/debug/lua-rs`.

## Run

```bash
target/debug/lua-rs script.lua             # run a source file
target/debug/lua-rs -e 'print(1 + 2)'      # run a one-liner
target/debug/lua-rs 'print("bare source")' # a bare argument is treated as source
target/debug/lua-rs                        # REPL (no arguments)
target/debug/lua-rs -                      # read a script from stdin
LUA_RS_VERSION=5.1 target/debug/lua-rs s.lua  # select a Lua version (5.1–5.5; default 5.4)
```

## Tests: the oracle is the source of truth

A change is **unverified** until an oracle says it behaves like reference C.
Build success is not signal.

One command runs everything CI runs (it builds its own binary, so there is no
stale-binary trap):

```bash
make test          # build + Rust tests + full conformance suite
```

The other Makefile targets:

```bash
make rust          # workspace unit/integration tests + embedding doctests
make conformance   # official Lua 5.4 suite only
make perf          # benchmark vs reference C Lua (measurement, not a gate)
make scaling       # flag superlinear (O(n^2)) behavior in hot operations
make setup         # recreate the reference/lua-c/testes symlink if missing
```

`make scaling` and `make perf` are how you check a change for complexity or
throughput regressions. `make scaling` runs each operation in
`harness/bench/scaling/` at growing sizes and fails if any goes superlinear;
that is the gate that catches O(n^2) bugs.

Under the hood, the conformance harness:

```bash
# Full upstream Lua 5.4.7 suite (the headline gate)
TEST_TIMEOUT_S=90 ./harness/run_official_all.sh

# A single official test
./harness/run_one_test.sh reference/lua-c/testes/strings.lua

# Inspect a failure
tail -120 harness/impl/official/<test>.out
```

`harness/impl/official/run_all.tsv` is the canonical scoring artifact. Do **not**
commit `harness/impl/official/*.out` — they regenerate on every run.

GC-sensitive changes should also run the canaries:

```bash
./harness/canaries/gc/run_canaries.sh
```

## Project layout

```
crates/
  lua-lex, lua-parse, lua-code   # front end: lexer, parser, bytecode compiler
  lua-vm                         # the register VM and core runtime
  lua-types                      # LuaValue, tables, strings, errors
  lua-gc                         # garbage collector (budgeted unsafe)
  lua-stdlib                     # standard library
  lua-coro                       # coroutines
  lua-cli                        # the `lua-rs` binary + dynamic-load backend
harness/                         # oracles, benchmarks, enforcement gates
docs/                            # architecture, performance, and porting docs
reference/                       # pinned upstream Lua 5.4.7 (the oracle; not edited)
```

## Code style (enforced)

These rules are mechanically checked by hooks in `.claude/hooks/` and will fail a
commit/Stop event if violated:

- **No inline `//` comments.** If something is worth explaining, put it in a doc
  string. (`// SAFETY:` justifications on `unsafe` blocks are the exception and
  are required.)
- **No fallback patterns** (`x || y || z`). Use a single source of truth; if data
  might be missing, fix the data path rather than papering over it.
- **No `String` / `&str` for Lua data.** Lua strings are byte strings — use
  `&[u8]` / `Vec<u8>` / `LuaString`.
- **`unsafe` is budgeted.** The workspace defaults to `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.
  Only `lua-gc` and `lua-cli` carry a budget; every `unsafe` block needs a
  `// SAFETY:` comment and must stay under the per-crate ceiling in
  `harness/unsafe-budgets.toml`. Run `.claude/hooks/unsafe-budget.sh` to check.
- **Never edit `reference/lua-c/testes/`.** The upstream tests are the oracle.
- **Every `crates/**/*.rs` carries a PORT STATUS trailer.** See `PORTING.md` §12.

## Making a change

1. Reproduce the target behavior as a tiny `lua-rs -e '...'` snippet first.
2. Patch the smallest cause; don't normalize a whole subsystem for one assertion.
3. Re-run the test that exposed the issue plus its adjacent gates.
4. Build before final verification: `cargo build --bin lua-rs`.
5. Keep temporary debugging (`eprintln!`, scratch files) out of the final diff.

The full debugging playbook lives in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
